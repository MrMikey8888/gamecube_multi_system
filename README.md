# gamecube_multi_system


This is starter code to connect multiple gamecubes to a single contoller via arduno boards. 

I have come to realise that rasbery pi are cheaper and better for this application so i want to port the project to that. 
This comes with a substantual increase in difficulity sadly, so work will be slow. 

I am in the process of preping the programs struture. Due to the time sensitive nature of the code and the tight timings i dont have alot of instructions to play around with, 
(its better then the arduino but managing multiple consoles from one board is alot more difficult). Hence progress will be slow. IF i can justify now working in assembaly i will do that but i suspect that working in asembaly will make the program more simple (to write) due to the increased contole. 

I will archive the current code and provide some notes about what does what if someone else wants to finish it at some point.
